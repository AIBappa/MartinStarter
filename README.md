This folder captures the attempts to create a starter template for Martin Vector Tile Server + MapLibre.
Currently "Startercode" shows promise.

How to start?
1) Follow the quickstart for Linux at the following link. This will start a Martin Tile Server. Refer: https://maplibre.org/martin/quick-start-linux.html. These steps were carried on a Windows 10 machine in the WSL environment.
2) The file used for starting the fileserver was in local storage "india-latest.pmtiles". Create this file using methods noted in the slide deck (power point presentation) at following link: https://github.com/maplibre/workshop
3) Use the proposed startercode(s) index.html in this github repository and open the folder where index.html resides using VSCode Insiders.
4) Use the Live Server extension in VSCode Insiders to open the index.html file and view the output map at the Live Server localhost:port.(This port can be configured in settings for Live Server).
